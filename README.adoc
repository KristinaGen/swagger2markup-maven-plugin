== Overview

The primary goal of https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup] is to *simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that's been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation* produced by https://github.com/swagger-api[Swagger]. The result is intended to be an *up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide*, comparable to https://developer.github.com/v3/[GitHub's API documentation]. The output of the plugin can be used as an alternative to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[swagger-ui] and can be served as static content.

The Swagger2Markup Maven Plugin simplifies the usage of https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup]. The Plugin adds a Maven goal which converts a Swagger JSON or YAML file into several *AsciiDoc* or *GitHub Flavored Markdown* documents. The plugin supports the Swagger 1.2 and 2.0 specification. Internally the plugin uses https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup] which in turn uses the _official_ https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser[swagger-parser] and a https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/markup-document-builder[markup-document-builder].

You can use the plugin to convert your contract-first Swagger YAML file into a human-readable format and combine it with hand-written documentation. As an alternative, you can choose the code-first approach and use Swagger2Markup together with https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/tree/master/samples/java-jersey2[Swagger JAX-RS], https://github.com/springfox/springfox[springfox] or https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs[spring-restdocs]. See https://github.com/RobWin/swagger2markup#using-swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup user guide] for more details.

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] is preferable to Markdown as it has more features. AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be converted to *HTML*, *PDF* and *EPUB*. AsciiDoc is much better suited for describing public APIs than *JavaDoc* or *Annotations*.

You can generate your HTML5, PDF and EPUB documentation via the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin[asciidoctor-gradle-plugin]. You can also use https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake[JBake], https://github.com/tomchristie/mkdocs[MkDocs], https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org[ReadTheDocs] or https://github.com/tripit/slate[slate] to publish your AsciiDoc or Markdown documentation.

The project requires at least JDK 7.
